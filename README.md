ðŸ“‚ Included Artifacts

1. Project One: Runtime and Memory Analysis Report

Analyzed the efficiency of vector, hash table, and binary search tree implementations in terms of time and space complexity.

Demonstrated understanding of Big-O notation and how it affects program performance.

2. Project Two: Advising Assistance Program (Working C++ Code)

Command-line program that loads, stores, and prints course data in alphanumeric order.

Uses the data structure chosen from Project One to manage course information efficiently.

ðŸ§© Reflection

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The goal was to design and implement a program that helps academic advisors at ABC University quickly find and display course information. This involved reading course data from a file, storing it in an efficient data structure, and printing the results in sorted order.

How did you approach the problem?
I began by analyzing which data structure best suited the needs of the project. Understanding data structures was key because each oneâ€”vector, hash table, and binary search treeâ€”has trade-offs in speed and memory usage. I compared them based on insertion, search, and traversal performance before deciding which to implement.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered?
Some of the main challenges were debugging file-reading errors and ensuring proper sorting logic. I overcame these issues by testing smaller parts of the program first and reviewing my pseudocode step by step to identify logical mistakes. Reading compiler error messages carefully and using sample CSV data helped me fine-tune the program.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
These projects taught me to think about efficiency and scalability early in the design process. I now understand that the choice of data structure directly affects how software performs, especially as the data size grows. Planning the structure and algorithm before writing any code has become a part of my process.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I have learned the importance of clean organization, consistent formatting, and meaningful comments. Breaking the code into clear functions makes future updates easier, and Iâ€™m more aware of how to design programs that others can understand and maintain. Using modular code and descriptive variable names has improved both readability and collaboration potential.
